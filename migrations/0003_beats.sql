-- Beats: VictoriaPark becomes a frontier-technology newsroom.
--
-- It launched as a crypto property. The claim graph — raw items clustering into
-- events, events decomposing into claims, claims carrying provenance — was
-- never crypto-specific, so widening the subject matter is an extension rather
-- than a rewrite. What it did lack was a way to say *which desk* a story
-- belongs to.
--
-- Beat is deliberately separate from `category`. They are orthogonal: "policy"
-- means the EU AI Act on one desk and a stablecoin bill on the other, "security"
-- means model jailbreaks or bridge exploits. Folding them into one flat list
-- would force a choice between losing the section or duplicating every one of
-- them per desk.
--
-- Existing rows are crypto by definition — everything published before this
-- migration was from the crypto roster.

-- Two more source kinds.
--
-- `research` is preprint servers — arXiv and the like. A paper is not a news
-- item: it has authors, an abstract and no editor, and treating it as one would
-- put "we propose a novel attention variant" on the front page as if it were
-- reporting.
--
-- `forum` is Hacker News and Reddit. These are discussion, not reporting: the
-- signal is that practitioners are arguing about something, and the item is a
-- pointer to that argument. Their trust scores are low for exactly that reason
-- and they must never count as corroboration for a claim.
