# Push a release bundle to the host in chunks, when it cannot pull one itself.
#
# nyc01 runs on WiFi with roughly 3.6% packet loss (eno2 is unplugged). At that
# rate TCP congestion control collapses on any sustained transfer: a 16 MB
# download from GitHub reads 0 B/s, and scp of the same file dies having moved
# nothing. Measured on the same link, a 256 KB scp completes in ~43 seconds.
#
# So: cut the bundle into pieces small enough to finish between loss events,
# push each with retries, reassemble on the far side and verify the whole thing
# by sha256 before it is allowed near the installer.
#
# This is a workaround for a broken link, not a deployment strategy. Plugging
# the ethernet cable in makes it unnecessary.
#
# Usage:  deploy/push-bundle.sh v0.12.0
