//! Refusals worth remembering.
//!
//! A model saying "no" is a result, not an error, and it costs exactly as much
//! as a "yes". The Gander declined 279 of 290 topic framings — correctly, on
//! topics that had not yet earned one — but nothing wrote that down, so the
//! same subjects came round again every pass. On an allowance that buys a few
//! hundred calls a day, re-asking a question already answered is the difference
//! between a desk that publishes and one that does not.
//!
//! Backoff is exponential and capped: a topic that is not a story today may
//! well be one tomorrow, so this defers a question rather than closing it.
