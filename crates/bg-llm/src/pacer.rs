//! A token-per-minute pacer.
//!
//! Hosted free tiers meter tokens per minute, not requests. Groq's is 8,000.
//! Without pacing, the newsroom fires a pass's worth of calls as fast as it
//! can, spends the minute in the first few seconds, and then takes 429s for the
//! rest — which the retry loop absorbs by sleeping 75 seconds at a time. On a
//! live worker that looked like this, every pass:
//!
//! ```text
//! WARN rate limited; waiting task=gosling.triage attempt=1 wait_s=75
//! WARN rate limited; waiting task=gosling.triage attempt=2 wait_s=75
//! WARN rate limited; waiting task=gosling.triage attempt=3 wait_s=75
//! ```
//!
//! Three blind waits, then the stage gives up and everything downstream —
//! clustering, publishing, analysis — is starved. The site stops updating while
//! the budget goes unspent.
//!
//! Waiting *before* the call instead of after the rejection costs the same
//! wall-clock time and gets the work done. The retry loop stays as a backstop
//! for when our estimate is wrong or another process shares the key.
