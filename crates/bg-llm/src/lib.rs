//! One trait, three providers, and a cost ledger.
//!
//! Agents never name a model. They ask for a [`ModelTier`] and this crate
//! resolves it per provider, so switching the whole newsroom from Anthropic to
//! a local Ollama is an environment variable rather than a code change.
//!
//! ## The stub provider is not a mock
//!
//! [`stub::StubProvider`] generates deterministic output from the caller's JSON
//! schema. That makes the entire pipeline runnable with no API key and no cost
//! — which is what lets the policy engine, the clustering, the database writes
//! and the rendering all be tested end to end without spending anything or
//! depending on the network.
