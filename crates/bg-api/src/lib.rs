//! # bg-api — the machine-readable layer
//!
//! The half of the thesis that isn't a website. Decrypt and CoinDesk publish
//! HTML; an agent that wants their reporting has to scrape it. VictoriaPark
//! publishes the claim graph directly — every story, claim, source and
//! confidence score over REST, plus an MCP server so an AI agent can query the
//! newsroom as a tool rather than parsing pages.
//!
//! Everything here is public and unauthenticated by design. The product is the
//! provenance; making it hard to read would defeat the point.
