//! The agent that looks after the newsroom itself.
//!
//! Every other agent works on the news. This one works on the machine that
//! makes it: it reads the health signals, decides which are actionable, fixes
//! what it can safely fix, and writes down the rest.
//!
//! ## Why it exists
//!
//! Every fault found in this codebase over the last week was found by a person
//! running `bg doctor`, reading a number, and thinking about it. Markets and
//! Tech published nothing for eight and thirteen days. 1,407 of 1,438 stories
//! carried a single source. 359 items held text their publishers had asked not
//! be used that way. None of those were subtle — each was a number sitting in a
//! health check waiting to be noticed, and nothing was doing the noticing.
//!
//! A newsroom that runs itself has to include the running.
//!
//! ## Deliberately without a model
//!
//! Not one call. Three reasons, in order of weight:
//!
//! 1. **It has to work when nothing else does.** The condition most worth
//!    catching is the newsroom being broken, and "the inference provider is
//!    refusing us" is one of the ways it breaks. A health check that needs the
//!    provider is offline exactly when it matters.
//! 2. **There is no budget for it.** Measured, the newsroom runs at 123% of its
//!    daily token cap. Spending any of it on watching itself would come out of
//!    reporting.
//! 3. **These questions are arithmetic.** "Has this desk published today", "is
//!    the queue growing", "are we holding text we said we would not" — a model
//!    would add latency, cost and a chance of being wrong, and subtract
//!    nothing.
//!
//! ## What it may and may not do
//!
//! It acts only where the action is **reversible and its own**: reconciling a
//! denormalised counter, erasing text a publisher declined, disabling a source
//! that has failed repeatedly. It never publishes, never retracts a story,
//! never edits copy, and never touches code.
//!
//! Everything else it writes down. A finding it cannot act on is reported, not
//! silently swallowed — an agent that quietly decides a problem is unfixable is
//! worse than no agent, because it also stops anyone else looking.
