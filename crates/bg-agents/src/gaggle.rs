//! Opening a special topic when coverage converges.
//!
//! A skein is geese in flight; a gaggle is geese on the ground. The Skein reads
//! where one story is heading — this is what happens when many stories turn out
//! to be about the same thing.
//!
//! **Detection costs nothing.** Which subjects independent outlets are
//! converging on falls out of headline arithmetic ([`bg_core::trends`]), and on
//! a tier that allows 200,000 tokens a day, spending any of them to notice that
//! seven newsrooms wrote about the same bill would be indefensible.
//!
//! A model is consulted for one thing only: naming and framing the topic once
//! it has already been established as hot. That is a writing job, and it is a
//! single small call per topic — not per story, and not per pass, since a
//! gaggle that stays hot is refreshed in place rather than re-written.
//!
//! The threshold is deliberately high. A special topic that appears whenever
//! three outlets mention a company is not special, and a site covered in
//! auto-generated topic hubs is the thing this must not become.
