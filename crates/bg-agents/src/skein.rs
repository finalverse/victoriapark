//! **Skein** — what the story means, and where it goes.
//!
//! A skein is geese in flight formation: the flock seen as a direction rather
//! than as birds. This agent is the one place VictoriaPark asserts something no
//! source said, which makes it both the reason to read the site and the easiest
//! thing here to get badly wrong.
//!
//! Three constraints keep it honest, and each exists because the alternative
//! failed in practice:
//!
//! 1. **A grounding gate.** Below [`MIN_GROUNDING_CHARS`] of real source text
//!    the Skein does not run. Thirty fabricated stories reached the site once
//!    because a model was handed bare headlines and asked to elaborate; a model
//!    asked to find meaning in a headline will always find some.
//! 2. **A falsifiable direction.** Every forecast carries a horizon and a list
//!    of signals that would confirm or refute it. A prediction with no deadline
//!    and no test cannot be wrong, and so is not worth the reader's time.
//! 3. **Quotes are extracted, never composed.** They enter the claim graph as
//!    [`ClaimKind::Quote`] with the excerpt attached to the specific item it
//!    came from, and are truncated to the policy limit before storage rather
//!    than trusted to a word count the model did itself.
