/// How many items go into one triage call.
///
/// Batching is what makes triaging every item affordable — 25 items in one
/// call instead of 25 calls. Larger batches save more but degrade judgement as
/// the model's attention spreads across the list.
/// Sized against the limit that actually binds, which is requests, not tokens.
///
/// This was cut from 25 to 10 when a big batch reserving 4k tokens ate most of
/// a minute's token budget and the next call 429'd. That reasoning was sound
/// and aimed at the wrong meter. Groq's free tier allows 8,000 tokens a minute
/// — about 11.5 million a day — but only **1,000 requests a day**, refilling
/// one every 86 seconds. Tokens are abundant; calls are not.
///
/// Batching does not reduce tokens at all: cost scales linearly with items,
/// roughly 235 apiece once the reservation is counted. It reduces *requests*,
/// and that is the budget the newsroom actually runs out of.
///
/// But the batch cannot grow without limit, and thirty was already too far. A
/// request whose estimate exceeds the whole per-minute allowance trips the
/// pacer's "too big to schedule" escape hatch and goes out **unpaced** — which
/// is how triage went straight back to `retry in 286s` after the batch was
/// raised. Sizing:
///
/// ```text
///   system prompt        ~1,000 tokens
///   per item              ~85 in + ~150 reserved out
///   usable minute budget   7,200  (8,000 less the safety margin)
/// ```
///
/// Twenty items lands near 5,700 — comfortably inside, so it is actually
/// scheduled — and still halves the request count against ten.
