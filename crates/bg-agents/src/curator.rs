//! **Curator** — decides what is one story and what is five.
//!
//! The hinge of the whole system. Getting this wrong in one direction shows the
//! same hack five times on the front page; in the other it silently merges two
//! unrelated events and reports them as corroborating each other. The second
//! failure is worse, so the thresholds are tuned to split when uncertain.
//!
//! Three-stage cascade, cheapest first:
//!
//! 1. **Lexical** — SimHash + trigram similarity against recent clustered
//!    items. Free, and decisive for the clear cases at both ends.
//! 2. **LLM adjudication** — only for the ambiguous middle band, where two
//!    items are plausibly the same event but the wording differs.
//! 3. **New story** — the default when nothing matches.
//!
//! Most items never reach stage 2, which is what makes clustering affordable
//! at the volume Scout produces.
