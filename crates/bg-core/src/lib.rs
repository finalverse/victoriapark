//! # bg-core
//!
//! The VictoriaPark domain model, shared verbatim between the Rust server and the
//! WebAssembly client. Everything here must compile for
//! `wasm32-unknown-unknown` — no tokio, no sqlx, no reqwest.
//!
//! VictoriaPark inverts the usual newsroom data model. Conventional CMSes treat the
//! *article* as the atomic unit: an opaque blob of prose with a byline. Here the
//! atomic units are the **event** ([`Story`]) and the **claim** ([`Claim`]), each
//! carrying its own provenance and confidence. An [`Article`] is a *rendering* of
//! a claim set, not the source of truth.
//!
//! ```text
//!   RawItem  ──cluster──▶  Story  ──extract──▶  Claim  ──render──▶  Article
//!      │                                          │                    │
//!   provenance                              corroboration          citations
//! ```
//!
//! That inversion is what lets the site show, for any sentence on any page, how
//! many independent sources back it and what happened when they disagreed.
