/// Whether a headline arrived already cut off by whoever published it.

/// Some syndicators truncate: Pluang and moomoo Community push titles like
/// "Bitcoin falls below $76K, wiping out $100M in l…" and Google News passes
/// them through verbatim, so the story reaches us with words missing and no way
/// to recover them.
///
/// It is not a parsing bug and there is nothing to fix in the text — but a
/// headline severed mid-word is the one thing that should never lead a front
/// page, because it reads as *our* mistake. Stories like this stay in the Wire,
/// where a clipped line is a minor blemish rather than the first thing a reader
/// sees.
/// Any trailing ellipsis counts, deliberately.
///
/// Distinguishing a severed word from an author's ellipsis is not reliably
/// possible from the text: "wiping out $100M in l..." and "The Fed blinked.
/// Again..." both end in a letter followed by three dots, and the only thing
/// that actually separates them is knowing the publisher truncates at a fixed
/// width. Encoding that would be a guess dressed as a rule.
///
/// So the test is the crude one, because the two errors are not symmetric. A
/// false negative puts a broken headline at the top of the front page. A false
/// positive means a story with a stylistic ellipsis leads from the Wire instead
/// of the lead slot, which nobody will ever notice.
