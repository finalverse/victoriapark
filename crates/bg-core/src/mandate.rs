//! What an agent is permitted to spend, and on what.
//!
//! ## Why this shape
//!
//! CreditChain's primitive for machine spending is a **policy-bound agent
//! wallet**: a budget, a time window, and an allowlist, so "machines transact
//! under rules humans can verify". The Flock is eleven agents already spending
//! real money on inference, metered per run. Those are the same object, and
//! VictoriaPark had the weaker half of it — one global budget, checked before each
//! stage, with no notion of which agent was spending or what for.
//!
//! That gap is not theoretical. A loop in the Skein could exhaust the day's
//! entire allowance before anything noticed, and every other agent would then
//! fail for the rest of the day with no indication of why. A mandate per agent
//! contains the blast radius to the agent that has the bug.
//!
//! ## Why it is worth denominating in CCC
//!
//! `/flock` publishes what each agent cost. Today that is VictoriaPark reporting on
//! VictoriaPark — the reader is asked to take it on trust, which is precisely the
//! thing this site exists not to ask. A mandate is a *public commitment made in
//! advance*: this agent may spend this much, on these tasks, until this time.
//! Settled against CreditChain, the commitment and the receipts are checkable
//! by someone who does not trust us at all.
//!
//! That is the honest reason to put a token near a newsroom. Not to charge
//! readers, not to mint something to sell — to make an accountability claim
//! falsifiable.
//!
//! ## What this module does and does not do
//!
//! It decides and it records. It holds no keys, signs nothing and sends
//! nothing. Settlement is a separate, explicitly authorised step, and **CCC is
//! a test network token with no monetary value** — the numbers here are a unit
//! of account for metering, and the code says so wherever a reader might
//! reasonably assume otherwise.
