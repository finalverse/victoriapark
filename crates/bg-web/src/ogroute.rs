//! The pictures that represent a story off-site: `/og/:slug.png` and `/img/:slug`.
//!
//! ## Why both, and why they are both on our own domain
//!
//! A VictoriaPark link pasted into WeChat rendered as a grey chain-link icon, the
//! bare domain, and no description — while a Reuters link in the same chat
//! showed the roundel, the headline and a standfirst. The metadata was not the
//! problem; every tag was present and correct. Three other things were:
//!
//! * **`og:image` pointed at somebody else's CDN.** A story sourced from
//!   YouTube advertised `i.ytimg.com`, which is not reachable from mainland
//!   China, where WeChat's crawler runs. The card cannot render a picture it
//!   cannot fetch. Hotlinking was also spending a publisher's bandwidth on our
//!   share cards, and inheriting their outages and their hotlink rules.
//! * **Cards were rendered on demand.** Cold, `/og/:slug` measured 8.9 seconds.
//!   Crawlers do not wait that long; several give up in two.
//! * **The card was the wrong shape for the client.** See [`ogcard::Shape`].
//!
//! So: `/img/:slug` serves *our copy* of the publisher's picture, and
//! `/og/:slug.png` serves a card we drew. Either way the crawler fetches
//! `victoriapark.io`, and either way the answer comes off disk.
//!
//! ## The mirror is not an open proxy
//!
//! `/img/:slug` takes a **slug**, never a URL. The only thing it will ever
//! fetch is the image URL already recorded against a *published* story, so
//! there is no parameter for a caller to point at an internal address. A URL
//! handed to us in a request is never fetched.
//!
//! Held stories are unreachable through both routes, for the same reason they
//! are unreachable on the site: `published_by_slug` is the only lookup used. A
//! card rendering the headline of a story we decided not to publish would leak
//! it just as effectively as the page would.
