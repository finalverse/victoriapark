//! The design constraint is politeness. VictoriaPark reads other people's servers
//! continuously and forever, so every request carries an identifying user
//! agent, honours robots.txt, sends conditional-GET validators, and runs under
//! a concurrency cap. A source that blocks us is a source we lose permanently.
